# MISUserRegistry

Goal of this program is to create a user registry for the Minnesota Indonesian Society (MIS)
Should allow for users to register to be part of MIS and keep track of who has signed up and who has paid.

Idea is to just use the google sheets api which will allow for quick additions and changes to the sheet while not needing to setup a lot of extra external tools.

Will allow for member addition, removal, and status changes.
Members should have first name, last name, email, phone, and date joined
